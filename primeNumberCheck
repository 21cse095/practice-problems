}//why we are iterating till square root of that particular number 
Consider a natural number N (greater than 1) which exists as a product of two numbers a and b (assume a<=b) that is 

N = a * b  where, 1 < a ≤ b < n
By multiplying the relation a ≤ b by a, the relation becomes:

a2 ≤ ab     
By multiplying the relation a ≤ b by b, the relation becomes: 

ab ≤ b2
From the above-mentioned inequalities, the relation becomes: 

a2 ≤ ab ≤ b2
We know that N = a * b, so by replacing a * b with N, the following relation is obtained:

a2 ≤ N ≤ b2
Taking the square root of the equation, considering both a and b as positive numbers, we get:

a ≤ sqrt(N) ≤ b
